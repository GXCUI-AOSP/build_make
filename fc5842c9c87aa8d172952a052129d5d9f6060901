      "message": "Yes, I think so.\n\nIIRC, the reason it was like this was that, once-upon-a-time, dtbs for some arm64 targets (early 64-bit 8916 with CAF trees) were built under $(KERNEL_OUT)/arch/arm/boot/dts/, and I think this was added to help with transitioning them over to $(KERNEL_OUT)/arch/arm64/boot/dts/\n\nI think this has long since been fixed.  8992/8994/8996 all put them in the right place.  Quickly checking how 8916 is built now may be worth it though.",
