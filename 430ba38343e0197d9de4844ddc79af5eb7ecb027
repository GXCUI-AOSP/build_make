      "message": "I inserted the call to adb root here to avoid conflict with the built-in delay. There would be no point in sleeping and calling adb wait-for-device after the call to adb root, since adb root fails if no device is connected. If you are still concerned about the adb root call interfering with the delay, I can move it to line 640, after the script has pushed the zipfile, since adbd only needs to be root for the push to /cache/recovery.",
